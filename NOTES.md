# Notes: ideas etc

## Phases of gameplay
 - Make the colors symbolize a lot
 - blink before change?
 - speed up quickly in difficulty

## Objectives
 - Circles in the right rythm (a lot like OSU)
 - keyboard? (maybe not because we can't take the keyboard out of control (or can we?)))
   - we can set some keys and change the function between them

# TODO
 - Every thing gameplay wise
 - Point system
 - Help section
 - Settings section
 - etc...
